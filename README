Slideshow
----------
(1) upload the image to images/slideshow
(2) image resolution should be 225x300 (Bug#1 : if images other than this resolution are used then the slideshow will be clutterd)
(3) create the image cache after uploading the image. To do this visit HOST/php/util/create_slide_cache.php. You should see success message.

known issue: time taken to load each page is very huge since because of slideshow.


Gallery
-------
(1) gallery will be avaiable under products tab
(2) add both the thumbnail (images/thumbs/) and the source image (images/album). Name of the file should be same in both.
(3) Add the file name in php/pages/gallery.php (FIXME)
(4) Resolutions - thumbnail:75x100, images: less than 800x600 for better look and feel.

Ticker
------
(1) location images/ticker
(2) resolution : x75 ( height should be 75px)
